# dbt2-athena-lab

A test bench for the AWS Athena adapter of dbt 2 (the Rust engine, [dbt-labs/dbt](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt)).
The adapter is being contributed as a series of pull requests that are not merged yet; this repository
assembles them on dbt's `main`, builds dbt with the Athena ADBC driver, and runs a matrix of checks
against a real AWS account. Each check reads the result back from Glue, S3, Lake Formation or Athena
rather than trusting an exit code.

Not an official dbt Labs project.

The tracking issue is [dbt-labs/dbt#16252](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/issues/16252).

## Quick start

Requirements: git, a Rust toolchain (`rustup`; the dbt repository pins the version), Go, `protoc`,
the AWS CLI v2, `jq`, Python 3 with `boto3`, and an AWS account where you can create Athena work
groups and IAM roles.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt ~/src/dbt
git clone https://github.com/dbt-labs/athena ~/src/athena
cp env.example.sh env.sh      # account, region, prefix, bucket, clone paths, optional sections
setup/setup.sh                # work groups, roles and the rest, named from the prefix
./rebuild-stack.sh            # stack/ = dbt main + the parts, driver/ = athena main + its PRs
./build.sh                    # debug dbt binary with the driver next to it
./run-matrix.sh               # logs/results.txt, one log per step in logs/
setup/teardown.sh             # removes what setup.sh and the matrix created
```

The scripts refuse to run against an account other than `LAB_ACCOUNT_ID`. To test a branch of one of
the parts before pushing it, point that part at it: `LAB_REF_16376=my-branch ./rebuild-stack.sh`.

## What the matrix covers

- **Credentials**: default chain, named profile, static keys, assume role with an external ID (and its
  refusal), explicit endpoint, polling interval.
- **Materializations**: seeds (CSV upload, `seed_by_insert`, SSE upload arguments), views, tables
  (Hive and Iceberg, `ha` swaps), incremental (append, insert_overwrite with partitions, Iceberg merge,
  microbatch, 150-partition batching, `partitions_limit`), snapshots, `on_schema_change` including
  struct columns, `persist_docs` to Glue, view version expiry, temporary tables left behind.
- **Metadata**: relations, columns and schemas read from Glue as dbt-athena reads them; column types
  compared line by line with dbt-core 1.11 + dbt-athena 1.11 (`project/expected/`); dropped Iceberg
  columns; mixed-case names; `dbt_utils.union_relations`; a Glue catalog registered in Athena and a
  catalog outside Glue; no `information_schema` query outside the docs catalog.
- **Runtime**: the adapter response in `run_results.json`, Iceberg commit conflicts rerun, Ctrl-C
  stopping the running query, `dbt retry`, tests, source freshness, docs.
- **Optional sections** (`env.sh`): Python models on an Athena Spark work group (including timeout and
  Ctrl-C), Lake Formation tags and data cell filters, `catalogs.yml` v2 with S3 Tables, Athena UDFs.

## Other runs

- `run-scale.sh`: 250 generated models and 250 tests on 16 threads, twice.
- `reference-dbt1/`: dbt-core 1.11 + dbt-athena 1.11 on the same tables, to regenerate the reference.
- `linux/`: a linux/arm64 release build of the stack and the driver, and an image to run it on ECS.
- `ecs-e2e/`: an Airflow DAG running the image through Astronomer Cosmos `ExecutionMode.WATCHER_AWS_ECS`
  ([astronomer/astronomer-cosmos#3000](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos/pull/3000)), on
  a Fargate cluster of your own.

## Cost

Athena queries of the matrix scan kilobytes. The Spark section starts Athena Spark sessions, which are
billed by DPU-hour while they run; the S3 Tables and Lake Formation sections create no running resources.
